## Summary

The xray configuration file is in json format, there is no difference between the client and server configuration formats, only the actual content of the configuration is different.
As follows:

```json
{
  "log": {},
  "api": {},
  "dns": {},
  "routing": {},
  "policy": {},
  "inbounds": [],
  "outbounds": [],
  "transport": {},
  "stats": {},
  "reverse": {}
}
```
