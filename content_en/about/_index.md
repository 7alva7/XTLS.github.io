**[Project X](https://github.com/XTLS) originates from XTLS protocol, provides a set of network tools such as [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) and [Xray-flutter](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-flutter).**
  - Xray-core is a superset of v2ray-core with a range of enhancements including better overall performance and XTLS, and is fully compatible with v2ray-core's features and configuration.
    - Only one executable file with ctl function, `run` is the default command.
    - The configuration is fully compatible and the environment variables and APIs should be changed to start with `XRAY_`.
    - ReadV with bare protocol is open across the platform.
    - Provides full VLESS & Trojan XTLS support, both with ReadV.
    - XTLS offers multiple flow control modes for unparalleled performance!
